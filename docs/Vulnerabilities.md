## zlib

<details>
<summary>zlib (Build 2529) - (STABLE) -- 1 critical vulnerability</summary>

- Affected release URL: [zlib (Build 2529) - (STABLE)](https://github.com/zopencommunity/zlibport/releases/tag/STABLE_zlibport_2529)

- **(CRITICAL severity) CVE-2023-45853**: MiniZip in zlib through 1.3 has an integer overflow and resultant heap-based buffer overflow in zipOpenNewFileInZip4_64 via a long filename, comment, or extra field. NOTE: MiniZip is not a supported part of the zlib product. NOTE: pyminizip through 0.2.6 is also vulnerable because it bundles an affected zlib version, and exposes the applicable MiniZip code through its compress API.
  - **This vulnerability is resolved in the [latest release](https://github.com/zopencommunity/zlibport/releases/tag/DEV_zlibport_2706)**.

<summary>vim (Build 2178) - (STABLE) -- 3 medium vulnerabilities</summary>

- Affected release URL: [vim (Build 2178) - (STABLE)](https://github.com/zopencommunity/vimport/releases/tag/STABLE_vimport_2178)

- **(MEDIUM severity) CVE-2024-41957**: Vim is an open source command line text editor. Vim < v9.1.0647 has double free in src/alloc.c:616. When closing a window, the corresponding tagstack data will be cleared and freed. However a bit later, the quickfix list belonging to that window will also be cleared and if that quickfix list points to the same tagstack data, Vim will try to free it again, resulting in a double-free/use-after-free access exception. Impact is low since the user must intentionally execute vim with several non-default flags,
but it may cause a crash of Vim. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0647
  - **This vulnerability is resolved in the [latest release](https://github.com/zopencommunity/vimport/releases/tag/STABLE_vimport_2736)**.
- **(MEDIUM severity) CVE-2024-41965**: Vim is an open source command line text editor. double-free in dialog_changed() in Vim < v9.1.0648. When abandoning a buffer, Vim may ask the user what to do with the modified buffer. If the user wants the changed buffer to be saved, Vim may create a new Untitled file, if the buffer did not have a name yet. However, when setting the buffer name to Unnamed, Vim will falsely free a pointer twice, leading to a double-free and possibly later to a heap-use-after-free, which can lead to a crash. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0648.
  - **This vulnerability is resolved in the [latest release](https://github.com/zopencommunity/vimport/releases/tag/STABLE_vimport_2736)**.
- **(MEDIUM severity) CVE-2024-45306**: Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Patch v9.1.0038 optimized how the cursor position is calculated and removed a loop, that verified that the cursor position always points inside a line and does not become invalid by pointing beyond the end of
a line. Back then we assumed this loop is unnecessary. However, this change made it possible that the cursor position stays invalid and points beyond the end of a line, which would eventually cause a heap-buffer-overflow when trying to access the line pointer at
the specified cursor position. It's not quite clear yet, what can lead to this situation that the cursor points to an invalid position. That's why patch v9.1.0707 does not include a test case. The only observed impact has been a program crash. This issue has been addressed in with the patch v9.1.0707. All users are advised to upgrade.

- Affected release URL: [grafana (Build 2267) - (STABLE)](https://github.com/zopencommunity/grafanaport/releases/tag/STABLE_grafanaport_67)

- **(HIGH severity) CVE-2024-9264**: The SQL Expressions experimental feature of Grafana allows for the evaluation of `duckdb` queries containing user input. These queries are insufficiently sanitized before being passed to `duckdb`, leading to a command injection and local file inclusion vulnerability. Any user with the VIEWER or higher permission is capable of executing this attack.  The `duckdb` binary must be present in Grafana's $PATH for this attack to function; by default, this binary is not installed in Grafana distributions.
