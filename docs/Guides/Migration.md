## UPDATE: New zopen framework is now available as of September 2023

The new zopen package manager is not compatible with the previous version of zopen. 

## Migration process
* Identify the tools you have already installed. Use `zopen install --list`.
* If you plan to reuse the existing zopen root directory for installing the new tools, 
  make sure to back it up to a different directory.
*
* Proceed to [Getting Started](QuickStart.md) and install the new package manager, and the tools you had before.
