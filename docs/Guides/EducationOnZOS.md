# Overview of z/OS

z/OS is an operating system designed for IBM mainframes. It is known for its mainframe architecture and ability to handle massive workloads. It provides two main interfaces for interacting with the system: z/OS UNIX and z/OS ISPF.

## z/OS UNIX

z/OS UNIX is a Unix-like environment that provides a shell and command-line interface similar to those found on other Unix systems. It allows users to run Unix applications and scripts on z/OS and provides a common interface for working with files and directories. It is command-line based and provides a higher level of access to the system, allowing users to execute commands with root privileges and perform advanced system administration tasks.

## z/OS Language Environment
The z/OS Language Environment is a runtime environment that provides the necessary services for programs written in high-level programming languages to run on the z/OS operating system. In other words, it's like a toolbox that developers can use to create and run their programs on z/OS.

When a program is compiled, it generates object code that is specific to the programming language used. However, in order for that object code to execute on z/OS, it needs to be linked with the appropriate runtime libraries provided by the z/OS Language Environment. These runtime libraries provide functions and services that the program needs to run properly, such as input/output operations, memory allocation, error handling, and more.

In addition to the runtime libraries, the z/OS Language Environment also includes a set of services that can be used by programs at runtime. These services include things like accessing system services, managing storage, handling signals and interrupts, and more.

The z/OS Language Environment supports a variety of high-level programming languages, including COBOL, PL/I, C, C++, and Java. Each of these languages has its own set of runtime libraries and services provided by the Language Environment.

Overall, the z/OS Language Environment is a crucial component of the z/OS operating system that enables programs written in high-level programming languages to run effectively and efficiently.

### Differences
Language Environment (LE) and GNU C Library (glibc) are two different runtime environments used by different operating systems.

LE is a runtime environment used by IBM's z/OS operating system. It provides an implementation of the C programming language standard that is optimized for z/Architecture processors. LE includes a set of run-time services that handle program startup and termination, memory management, input/output operations, and exception handling. LE also includes support for languages other than C, such as COBOL, PL/I, and Fortran.

On the other hand, glibc is a runtime library used by Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It provides an implementation of the C programming language standard that is optimized for the specific architecture and operating system. Glibc includes a set of functions that handle common operations such as string manipulation, memory allocation, and input/output operations.

The main differences between LE and glibc are:

Operating system: LE is used by z/OS, while glibc is used by Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

Architecture: LE is optimized for IBM's z/Architecture processors, while glibc is optimized for the specific architecture of the operating system.

Functionality: LE includes a set of run-time services that handle program startup and termination, memory management, input/output operations, and exception handling, while glibc includes a set of functions that handle common operations such as string manipulation, memory allocation, and input/output operations.

Compatibility: Programs written for LE are not compatible with glibc, and vice versa. If you want to run a program written for z/OS on Linux, you would need to recompile it using glibc.


### Supported z/OS Languages and Compilers
There are many different languages supported on z/OS, including C, C++, PLI, COBOL, REXX, Python and more.


# Interacting with z/OS Unix
## What is SSH?

SSH is a protocol used for secure remote access to a system. It provides a secure channel for logging in to a remote system and transferring files.

## 

There are several advantages to using SSH for remote access, including:

* Security: SSH encrypts all communication between the client and server, protecting your login credentials and other sensitive data.
* Flexibility: SSH can be used to access a wide range of systems and devices, including z/OS.
* Ease of use: SSH is easy to set up and use, and there are many tools available for working with SSH.

## Setting up SSH on your local machine
To log in to a z/OS system using SSH, you'll first need to set up SSH on your local machine. This involves creating a key pair and configuring the SSH client.

Sure, here are the basic steps to create an SSH key pair on z/OS:

* Open a terminal window.
* Enter the command ssh-keygen.
* You will be prompted to enter a file name for your key pair. The default name is id_rsa, but you can choose a different name if you prefer.
* You will also be prompted to enter a passphrase for your key pair. This is optional but highly recommended, as it adds an extra layer of security to your SSH connection.
* The key pair will be generated and saved in the .ssh directory in your home directory. The private key will be named id_rsa (or whatever name you chose), and the public key will be named id_rsa.pub.
* Here's an example of what the commands would look like in a terminal window:

```
$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
Note that the exact commands and prompts may vary slightly depending on your operating system and version of SSH.
```

## Setting up SSH on the z/OS system
You'll also need to configure the SSH server on the z/OS system to allow remote access using SSH. This involves setting up the SSH daemon and configuring access controls. If this has not been done, talk to your system administrator to set it up.

## Conclusion
By the end of this step, you should have a solid understanding of z/OS and SSH, and be ready to move on to more specific topics related to z/OS UNIX fundamentals.
