## Issues

Log an issue for any question or problem you might have. When in doubt, log an issue, and
any additional policies about what to include will be provided in the responses. The only
exception is security disclosures which should be sent privately.

Committers may direct you to another repository, ask for additional clarifications, and
add appropriate metadata before the issue is addressed.

## Contributions

Any change to resources in this repository must be through pull requests. This applies to all changes
to documentation, code, binary files, etc.

No pull request can be merged without being reviewed and approved.

## Validate your changes

Verify that the project is working by running `zopen build`.

## Coding Guidelines

When contributing your changes, please follow the following coding guidelines:

* patches: patches should adhere to the coding guidelines from the original project repository. Make sure to add the original project's LICENSE file within the patches
directory.
* zopen framework files: (e.g. buildenv) - It is recommended that you follow the [Google Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)

If you are generating a new project, we recommend that you use `zopen generate` to create the correct zopen file and directory structure.

## Automated Tests

We have set up automated tests for this repository using GitHub Actions. When you open a pull request or comment with `/run tests`, the following action will be triggered:

```yaml
name: Test Port

on:
  issue_comment:
    types:
      - created
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build-on-jenkins:
    if: github.event.issue.pull_request || contains(github.event.comment.body, '/run tests') || github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'
    uses: ZOSOpenTools/meta/.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml@main
    secrets: inherit
```

Please make sure your changes pass all the automated tests before merging your pull request. If the tests fail, our CI/CD system will provide information on what needs to be fixed.
