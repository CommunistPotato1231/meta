# VIM on z/OS

## Why VIM?
VIM is a popular and powerful text editor that is often used by programmers for writing code. While VIM is available on many different platforms, it can also be used on z/OS.

## How to obtain VIM on z/OS?
To obtain VIM on z/OS, download it from [VIM Github Release page](https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/vimport/releases).

Alternatively, you can use `zopen download` to download vim as follows:
```
zopen download vim ncurses
```
Since VIM depends on ncurses, we also need to download [ncurses](https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/ncursesport/releases) and source the .env file.

## How to use VIM?
To use VIM on z/OS, first source the .env file provided with the VIM on z/OS release as follows:
```
. ./.env
```
This will set the appropriate PATH, VIM, MANPATH environment variables.

Now, you can use VIM to edit new or existing files:
```
vim new.txt # create a new file
vim ~/.profile # edit an existing file
```

VIM on z/OS currently understands the `IBM-1047` and `ISO8959-1` file tags. If you are editing a file that is untagged or editing a new file, VIM will save it as ISO8959-1 (ASCII).

## Improving your VIM experience with various tools and plugins

### Cscope
**Cscope** is a tool that allows users to search for symbols, functions, and other code constructs in a codebase. This can be incredibly useful when working with large codebases on z/OS, as it allows users to quickly navigate and find the code they need.

To use Cscope, first download it using `zopen download cscope` and then source the .env file as follows: `. ./.env`

Now, navigate to a codebase. Let's take the Git source as an example. Since Git is a C-based project, we'll use Cscope to a cscope database for all of the C source files and headers.
```
find . -name '*.c' -o -name "*.h" > cscope.files
cscope -b -i cscope.files # Create the cscope db file
```

Now, load up VIM from your project root directory. You can now use the `:cscope` tool to search the references to a definition.

For example:
```
:cscope find main all
```
Will locate all references to main

To map the cscope to shortcut keys, the following vim script is recommended: https://github.com/joe-skb7/cscope-maps/blob/master/plugin/cscope_maps.vim. You can copy and paste it to your .vimrc.

### CTags
Another useful tool is **ctags**, which is similar to cscope but operates at a lower level. Ctags generates a list of tags for a codebase, which can then be used by VIM to quickly navigate to specific functions and other code constructs. This can be a huge time-saver when working with complex codebases on z/OS.

To use CTags, first download it using `zopen download ctags` and then source the .env file as follows: `. ./.env`

Now, navigate to a codebase. Let's take the Git source as an example.
```
ctags -R . # this will create a tags file in the current dir
```

You can now load up VIM on a source file and then place your cursor on a function, variable, or type and use the ctrl-] short-cut to jump to its definition. To jump back, you can use ctrl-t.

### NERDTree
In addition to cscope and ctags, VIM users on z/OS may also want to consider using NERDTree, a plugin that allows users to view and navigate the directory structure of a codebase. This can be useful for quickly switching between files and folders, and is especially useful for working with large codebases that have many different directories and files.

### VIM-Gitgetter
Finally, vim-gitgetter is a plugin that allows VIM users on z/OS to interact with Git repositories directly from within the editor. This can be incredibly useful for managing code changes and collaborating with other developers, as it allows users to easily manage branches, commit changes, and push code to remote repositories.
