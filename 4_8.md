kys# Shell Scripting Notes for Handling `metadata.json`

- Use `$RANDOM` for generating random variables in shell scripts.
- Use `$LOGNAME` to refer to the user's ID.
- To create a unique location for each user, combine the `$LOGNAME` and `$RANDOM` variables:
  ```sh
  unique_dir="/some/path/${LOGNAME}_${RANDOM}"
  ```
- This ensures every user has a unique location for `metadata.json` and prevents any collisions with previously downloaded files.
- Use `zopen_tmp_dir` instead of `/tmp/` to allow users to override the directory where `metadata.json` is downloaded.
- `zopen_tmp_dir` takes precedence over `/tmp/`, enabling this customizable functionality:
  ```sh
  target_dir="${zopen_tmp_dir:-/tmp}"
  ```
- Finally, delete the `metadata.json` file after the remote query has completed:
  ```sh
  rm "${metadataFile}"
  ```
- Follow best practices:
  - Use **curly braces** for variables: `${variable}`
  - Use **\`$()\`** for executing commands: `$(command)`
