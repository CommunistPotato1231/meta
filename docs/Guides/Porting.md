# Porting to z/OS

## Getting Started

The z/OS Open Tools porting projects reside in https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools.

Before you begin to build code, ensure that you have access to a z/OS UNIX environment and that your environment is correctly configured.

### Set up your environment

This is the most cumbersome step, but is only required to be done once.

The tools assume an ASCII/UTF-8 environment, and so you should ensure that you have the following environment
variables set:

```
export _BPXK_AUTOCVT=ON
export _CEE_RUNOPTS="$_CEE_RUNOPTS FILETAG(AUTOCVT,AUTOTAG) POSIX(ON)"
export _TAG_REDIR_ERR=txt
export _TAG_REDIR_IN=txt
export _TAG_REDIR_OUT=txt
```

It is recommended that you add the above environment variables to your `.profile` or `.bashrc` startup script.

You need to configure your user.email and user.name to check in code to the repositories:

```
git config --global user.email "<Your E-Mail>"
git config --global user.name "<Your Name>"
```
This assumes that you have the latest version of [Git](https://my.rocketsoftware.com/RocketCommunity#/downloads) on your z/OS system.


### Leveraging the z/OS Open Tools meta repo

The meta repo (https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/meta) consists of common tools and files that aid
in the porting process, including the `zopen` suite of tools.  Specifically, `zopen build` provides a common way to bootstrap, configure, build, check,
and install a software package.  `zopen download` provides a mechanism to download the latest published z/OS Open Tools.

Many tools depend on other tools to be able to build or run. You will need to provide both _bootstrap_ tools
(i.e. binary tools not from source), as well as _prod_ tools (i.e. _production_ level tools previously built
from another z/OS Open Tools repository).

Our goal is to eventually have our own version of all the _bootstrap_ tools, but right now, we rely on some
tools from Rocket. These Rocket tools can be downloaded [here](https://my.rocketsoftware.com/RocketCommunity#/downloads).

Many tools require a C or C++ compiler (or both). 
You can download a web deliverable add-on feature to your XL C/C++ compiler 
[here](https://www.ibm.com/servers/resourcelink/svc00100.nsf/pages/xlCC++V241ForZOsV24).
Alternatively, you can install and manage _C/C++ for Open Enterprise Languages on z/OS_ using _RedHat OpenShift Container Platform_ and _IBM Z and Cloud Modernization Stack_ 
[here](https://github.com/IBM/z-and-cloud-modernization-stack-community). 
Please note that these compilers are comparable, but how you perform installation and maintenance and pricing is different.

In order for zopen to be able to locate dependent tools, they need to be in well-defined locations.
Tools will be searched for in the following locations, in order:
- `${HOME}/zopen/prod/<tool>`
- `/usr/bin/zopen/<tool>`
- `${HOME}/zopen/boot/<tool>`

A convenience script, ` zopen-importenvs` can be used to source the environments of each of the tools:

```bash
. zopen-importenvs
```

So for example, `make` depends on `m4` to build. `zopen build` will search for `m4` first in the
personal _prod_ build from `${HOME}/zopen/prod/m4`, then the system-wide build in `/usr/bin/zopen/m4`, and
finally in the personal _boot_ directory `${HOME}/zopen/boot/m4`. Symbolic links can be used as required to share builds between developers on a system, if desired.  You can also add your own directories to the search path by specifying the -d option to `zopen build` as follows:
```bash
zopen build -d $HOME/mytools
```

Each tool is responsible for knowing how to set it's own environment up (e.g. PATH, LIBPATH, and any other environment variables).
Each tool needs to provide a `.env` program that can be source'd from it's directory to set up it's environment.
If you are building from a ZOSOpenTools port, this `.env` file will be created as part of the install process, but if you
are providing a `boot` version of the tool (e.g. cURL), then you will need to provide your own version of `.env`.

### Create your first z/OS port leveraging the zopen framework

Before you begin porting a tool to z/OS, you must first identify the tool or library that you wish to port. For the sake of this guide, let's assume we are porting [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), a lightweight and flexible json parser. Before porting a tool, check if the project already exists under https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools. If it does exist, then please collaborate with the existing contributors.

Begin first by cloning the https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/meta repo.  This repo contains the `zopen` framework and it is what we will use to build, test, and install our port.

```bash
# Clone the required repositories
git clone git@github.com:ZOSOpenTools/meta.git
```

Next, in order to use the `zopen` suite of tools, you must set your path environment variable to the `meta/bin` directory.
```bash
export PATH=<pathtozopen>/meta/bin:$PATH
```

Ok, now you are ready to begin porting. 

Begin first by generating a port template project by entering the following command:
```bash
zopen generate
```

`zopen generate` will ask you a series of questions. Answer them as follows:
```
Generate a zopen project...
* What is the project name?
jq
* Provided a description of the project:
A jq parser
* Enter the jqport's Git location: (if none, press enter)
git@github.com:stedolan/jq.git
* Enter jqport's build dependencies for the Git source: (example: curl make)
git make autoconf
* Enter the jqport's Tarball location? (if none, press enter)
https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/download/jq-1.6/jq-1.6.tar.gz
* Enter jqport's build dependencies for the Tar source: (example: curl make)
make
* Enter the default build type: (tar or git)
tar
Generating jqportport zopen project...
jqport/buildenv created...
jqport/README.md created...
jqport project is ready! Contact Mike Fulton (fultonm@ca.ibm.com) to create https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/jqport.git...
```

Change your current directory to the `jqport` directory: `cd jqport`. You will notice several files:
* README.md - A description of the project
* buildenv - The zopen configuration file that drives the build, testing, and installation of the project.
* cicd.groovy - The CI/CD configuration file used in the Jenkins pipeline
For more information, please visit the [zopen build README](https://github.com/ZOSOpenTools/meta)

Note: `zopen build` supports projects based in github repositories or tarball locations. Since autoconf/automake are not currently functioning on z/OS, we typically choose the tarball location because it contains a `configure` script pre-packaged. Let's go ahead and do this for `jq`.

In the `buildenv` file, you'll notice the following contents:
```bash
export ZOPEN_GIT_URL="git@github.com:stedolan/jq.git"
export ZOPEN_GIT_DEPS="git make autoconf"
export ZOPEN_TARBALL_URL="https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/download/jq-1.6/jq-1.6.tar.gz"
export ZOPEN_TARBALL_DEPS="make"
export ZOPEN_TYPE="TARBALL"

zopen_check_results()
{
  dir="$1"
  pfx="$2"
  chk="$1/$2_check.log"
  grep "All tests passed"
}

zopen_append_to_env()
{
  # echo extra envars here:
}
```
ZOPEN_TARBALL_DEPS/ZOPEN_GIT_DEPS are used to identify the non-standard dependencies needed to build the project. 

You are expected to modify `zopen_check_results()` with logic to analyze the test results and return the following return codes:
```
0 - Green - All tests passed
1 - Blue - Most tests passed
2 - Yellow - Most tests failed
3 - Red - All tests failed or check is broken
4 - Unknown - Skipped or something went wrong
```

`zopen_append_to_env()` can be used to add additional environment variables outside of the normal environment variables. (e.g. PATH, LIBPATH, MANPATH)

Next, we can go ahead and test our build.  Run the following:
```bash
zopen build -v
```

The `-v` option above specifies verbose output.

Once finished, you will notice that your project was built and installed under `$HOME/zopen/prod/jq`.

*Creating Patches*

As you may have noticed, `zopen build` downloads the `tar.gz` file, and then attempts to patch it with the patch contents in the `patches` directory.

As you port your application to z/OS, you will identify a set of _patches_. These patches represent the set of changes in order to get your tool or library to work on z/OS. To create a patch, change to the `jq-1.6` directory and perform a `git diff HEAD` and redirect your patches to a file in the patches directory.

```bash
cd jq-1.6
# Make your changes
# If there are any new files added, make sure to track them using git add
git add <newfiles>
git diff HEAD > ../patches/initial_zos.patch
```

In some cases, the tool directory will not be tracked by git (when using a tarball and/or the tool directory is included in .gitignore). In this case, you will need to create the patch by hand using diff and an untouched copy of the tool directory.

```bash
diff -r jq-1.6 jq-1.6.orig > patches/initial_zos.patch
```

Once you have a working prototype of your tool, you can proceed to the next step.

### Creating a repository under ZOSOpenTools

After you have a working z/OS prototype for your tool, you will need to create a repository to hold your contents.

Send an email to itodorov@ca.ibm.com or fultonm@ca.ibm.com with the following information:
* Name of the tool
* Current repository where contents reside
* List of Collaborators

Once your repository is created, you will be invited as a collaborator.

Proceed to clone the repository and submit a Pull Request including the initial contents of your z/OS port.

### Setting up the CI/CD pipeline

Once you have a working build of your z/OS Open Source tool, then you may add it to the z/OS Open Source Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.
