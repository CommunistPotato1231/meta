# Porting creduce to Z/OS: Progress Report

## Summary
Today, I attempted to port the creduce tool to Z/OS but encountered some dependency issues that require further support.

## Initial Setup
- Obtained the repository link from GitHub
- Created a new SSH key specifically formatted for GitHub access, as the default Z/OS key generation is incompatible with GitHub's requirements

## Using zopen Package Manager
- Utilized the zopen package manager's template generation functionality
- Ran `zopen generate` which prompted for:
  - Tool name
  - Description
  - Git repository location
  - Build dependencies
  - Other configuration details

## Configuration Process
- Navigated to the newly created directory
- Modified the buildenv file to add dependencies specified in the tool's install.md documentation
- Attempted to build the tool using `zopen-build -v` in the ported tool directory

## Challenges Encountered
- Build failed due to missing LLVM dependency
- LLVM is currently a proprietary IBM software
- Igor is contacting the IBM team to inquire about exposing the source code

## Git Author Correction
Since I was initially logged in as a different user, I had to update the commit authorship using:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your New Name"
git config --global user.email "your.new.email@example.com"
git commit --amend --author="Your New Name your.new.email@example.com"
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```
