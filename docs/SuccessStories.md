  "We have been looking for the z/OS USS environment to provide a state of the art "Unix" experience. Participating in the z/OS Open-source Guild meetings has allowed us to install, test and recommend additional tools to be included in the porting efforts. It reminds me of the positive experience in a previous IBM Sponsor User Research initiative. IBM is doing a great job leading all the participants.<br/><br/>
Through this effort, I have learned that the GNU collection of "free" software (typically packaged with Linux distributions) is the z/OS Open-Source strategy. z/OS and GNU software are a robust combination for hosting on-prem cloud native applications. <b>We see tremendous value moving the platform forward adopting the z/OS Open Tools.</b><br/><br/>
We are excited to find out more about IBM's strategy regarding packaging, delivery, and support for enterprise use."
